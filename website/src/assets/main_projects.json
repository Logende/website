          "abstract": "Textual formats to structure data, such as JSON, XML, and YAML, are widely used for structuring data in various domains, from configuration files to research data. However, manually editing data in these formats can be complex and time-consuming. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) can significantly reduce manual efforts and assist the user in editing the files, but developing a file-format-specific GUI requires substantial development and maintenance efforts. To address this challenge, we introduce MetaConfigurator: an open-source web application that generates its GUI depending on a given schema. Our approach differs from other schema-to-UI approaches in three key ways: 1) It offers a unified view that combines the benefits of both GUIs and text editors, 2) it enables schema editing within the same tool, and 3) it supports advanced schema features, including conditions and constraints. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of MetaConfigurator, backed by insights from a small-scale qualitative user study. The results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in retrieving information from data and schemas and in editing them.",

In this work, MetaConfigurator is viewed from the perspective of three exemplary real-world use case in fields such as biochemistry and ontology management.

We show how the tool can be used to streamline and simplify the process of data model creation. Furthermore, we use the tool to visualize and communicate data models with others. Using MetaConfigurator less mistakes are made and the entry barrier for data model creation is lowered.",

In the context of research data, these models are typically expressed as schemas that define the structure and semantics of datasets. However, many domains still lack standardized models, and creating them remains a significant barrier, especially for non-experts. We present a hybrid approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with deterministic techniques to enable JSON Schema creation, modification, and schema mapping based on natural language inputs by the user. These capabilities are integrated into the open-source tool MetaConfigurator, which already provides visual model editing, validation, code generation, and form generation from models. For data integration, we generate schema mappings from heterogeneous JSON, CSV, XML, and YAML data using LLMs, while ensuring scalability and reliability through deterministic execution of generated mapping rules. The applicability of our work is demonstrated in an application example in the field of chemistry. By combining natural language interaction with deterministic safeguards, this work significantly lowers the barrier to structured data modeling and data integration for non-experts.",

This includes, but is not restricted to fluid-structure interaction. preCICE treats these solvers as black-boxes and, thus, only minimally-invasive changes are necessary to prepare a solver for coupling. Ready-to-use adapters for well known open-source solvers, including OpenFOAM, SU2, CalculiX, FEniCS, and deal.II, are available, while the core library is included in the xSDK ecosystem. The software offers methods for equation coupling, fully parallel communication, data mapping, and time interpolation schemes. For more information, please visit https://precice.org/.",
