    <h3>
      Hi, I'm <b>Felix Neubauer</b>, a software engineer based in Germany with a
      passion for crafting well-architected, high-quality software.

      <br />

      I started programming in Java in 2012 and have since earned both my
      <b>Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degrees in Software Engineering</b>. After
      working at <b>Robert Bosch GmbH from 2019 to 2024</b> â€” developing
      software for self-driving cars with <b>C++ for embedded systems</b>,
      <b>Python-based tooling</b>, and <b>CI/CD pipelines</b> â€” I have now
      transitioned to full-time research as part of my <b>PhD</b>.

      <br />

      Beyond my research, I love experimenting with
      <b>Kotlin, Java, and TypeScript</b>, focusing on
      <b>software architecture</b>, <b>clean code</b>, <b>testing</b>,
      <b>DevOps</b>, and <b>API design</b>. My open-source projects have
      accumulated over a <b>million downloads</b>, and one of my Java minigames
      was featured by YouTubers with a combined audience of over 50 million
      subscribers.

      <br />

      Before transitioning to a full-time industry and then research job, I
      worked as a freelancer and sold my own Java software. Now, I continue to
      build impactful softwareâ€”most recently, <b>MetaConfigurator</b>, a schema
      editor and form generator for JSON and YAML, developed as part of my
      masterâ€™s thesis.

      <br />
